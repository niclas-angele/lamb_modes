# lamb_mode

Code to draw 3D Rayleigh-Lamb dispersion curves and visualize Lamb modes in 2D waveguides.

Main programs: 
  - disp3D.m
Programm to visualize 3D Rayleigh-Lamb dispersion curves, critical points and zoomed area around L, T and ZGV critical points

- visu_mode_lamb_2.m
Program to visualize any Lamb mode propagating in a 2D waveguide at a given frequency. The evolution of different sections of the waveguide is represented under symmetric and antisymmetric displacement.
